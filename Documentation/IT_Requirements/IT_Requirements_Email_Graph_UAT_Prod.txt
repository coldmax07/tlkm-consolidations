TLKM Confirmations
IT Requirements for Outbound Email
Microsoft Graph (App-Only), UAT and Production

Date: February 23, 2026

1) Why we are sending this
We need IT support so TLKM Confirmations can send system emails to users in UAT and Production.
This document only covers what we need from IT.

2) Email model to use
- Email must be sent through Microsoft Graph API (not SMTP).
- The application will use app-only authentication.

3) What we need from IT

A. Create Graph app access for each environment
- Create one app registration for UAT and one for Production (recommended).
- Provide for each environment:
  - Tenant ID
  - Client ID
  - App credential (secret or certificate; certificate preferred for Production)

B. Grant required permission
- Grant Microsoft Graph Application permission:
  - Mail.Send
- Grant admin consent for that permission.

C. Provide sender mailbox identity
- Provide approved sender mailbox(es) for each environment.
- Confirm display name and reply-to rules.
- Shared mailbox is acceptable if it meets IT policy.

D. Restrict what mailbox the app can send as
- Mail.Send is broad by default, so IT must restrict scope to approved sender mailbox(es).
- Preferred control: Exchange Online RBAC for Applications.
- Confirm this restriction is active in UAT and Production.

E. Define compliance and usage controls
- UAT sending restrictions (for example: test recipients only).
- Rate limits/quotas.
- Message tracing/logging availability.
- Security controls (DLP/scanning/retention) as required by policy.

F. Support and ownership
- Provide IT support owner and escalation contact for email delivery issues.
- Confirm credential rotation process and schedule.

4) Important clarification
- The app does not need an interactive Microsoft 365 user login account.
- The app signs in as an Entra application (service principal).
- A sender mailbox identity is still required for outgoing email.

5) What we need to receive back from IT
Please provide the following per environment (UAT and Production):
- Tenant ID
- Client ID
- Credential details (or secret manager reference)
- Confirmation that Mail.Send (Application) + admin consent is complete
- Approved sender mailbox(es)
- Confirmation of mailbox scope restriction
- IT support owner/contact

6) Go-live dependency
We cannot complete email rollout until IT provides and confirms all items above for both UAT and Production.
