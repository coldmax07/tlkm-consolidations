TLKM Confirmations
IT Requirements for Single Sign-On (SSO)
UAT and Production

Date: February 23, 2026

1) Why we are sending this
We need IT support to enable Microsoft sign-in for TLKM Confirmations in both UAT and Production.
This document only covers what we need from IT.

2) What we need from IT

A. Create and configure Microsoft Entra application access
- Create one app registration for UAT and one for Production (recommended).
- Provide the following for each environment:
  - Tenant ID
  - Client ID
  - App credential (secret or certificate)

B. Approve redirect URLs
- Approve the login callback URL for each environment:
  - UAT: https://<uat-domain>/auth/sso/callback
  - Production: https://<prod-domain>/auth/sso/callback

C. Confirm sign-in policy
- Confirm that only active users in Microsoft Entra can sign in.
- Confirm MFA/Conditional Access rules that must apply.
- Confirm whether UAT policies should match Production or be lighter for testing.

D. Provide environment separation
- UAT and Production must use separate app credentials.
- Credentials and URLs must not be shared between environments.

E. Confirm security and support controls
- Confirm who owns secret/certificate rotation and how often.
- Confirm logging and audit availability for sign-in success/failure.
- Confirm support contact and escalation path for SSO issues.

3) Important clarification
- We only need Microsoft Entra to confirm user identity and active status.
- Our application handles user roles and access permissions internally.
- IT does not need to design role mapping in Entra for TLKM application access.

4) Decisions needed from IT
- Are UAT and Production in one Entra tenant or separate tenants?
- Will credentials use certificates (preferred) or client secrets?
- Is single logout required?

5) What we need to receive back from IT
Please provide the following per environment (UAT and Production):
- Tenant ID
- Client ID
- Credential details (or secret manager reference)
- Approved callback URL
- Security policy confirmation (MFA/Conditional Access)
- IT support owner/contact

6) Go-live dependency
We cannot complete SSO rollout until IT provides and approves all items above for both UAT and Production.
